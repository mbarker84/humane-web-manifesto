A humane web should be:

### Accessible

Our websites should meet people where they are. They should be accessible to people with disabilities, and take into account the many different ways people might access the web. They should be empowering and equitable, not provide additional barriers.

### Inclusive

Our websites should not discriminate against based on race, gender, age, orientation, ability, class or economic status. Gatekeeping should be avoided.

### Safe

Our websites should not put people in danger. They should not serve harmful content, or content that encourages harm, violence or discrimination against others, nor should they support enablers of harm.

### Secure

Our websites should respect people’s privacy. They should respect data protection laws. We should afford visitors the confidence that their data will not be sold to third parties without their explicit knowledge and consent, and avoid hostile patterns that attempt to obtain consent through deception.

### Sustainable

Every care should be taken to minimise our websites’ environmental impact. They should be lean, clean, efficient, well-optimised, and avoid creating digital and physical waste.

### Reliable

Information provided on the web should be trustworthy and sourced appropriately. Visitors to a website should be afforded the confidence that content can be reliably accessed at a given URL, and will not disappear. Digital services should function in their time of need.

### Resilient

Our websites should be built with web standards, and utilise progressive enhancement. They should function across different devices, in different languages and under different environmental conditions.

### Transparent

The motivations and intent of a website should be made clear to the people using it. It should be easy to find out who owns, funds, and creates content for a website, when that information is in the public interest.

### Independent

No one “owns” the web. No single central authority decides who can publish on or access the web.

### Human-centred

Our websites should be designed by and for humans. They should be kind, collaborative, and foster connections, not isolation. A humane web should contribute to a better future.
